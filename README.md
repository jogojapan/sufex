# Sufex

## Overview

Sufex is an indexing and search system for linguistic purposes. It can
also be used as a C++ library of data structures relevant for
search. I am currently re-implementing it, and will add parts as they
get ready.

## How to build

    $> mkdir build
    $> cd build
    $> cmake ../src
    $> make
